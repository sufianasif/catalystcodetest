Database Connection

1. Running the commannd "php user_upload.php" displays the welcome message and displays the command to get help for the llist of directives. 
2. in order to connect to the database (username, password, host, db name, port) will have to be set before running --create_table command. 
3. To set the my sql variables the commands can be run and the reespective commands can be learned from running --help. 
4. The mySql variables are all stored in env.json file. 
5. Upon Running --create_table command data is retrieved from env.json and mySql connection is created and then "createDbTable()" function is called which 
   creates the table "users" if not already present in the database. 

File 

1. The command --file filename is run to enter the file name and is also seet in the env.json file. 
2. Upon running --run command the data from csv will be displayed as well as stored to the database. 
3. --dry_run on the conntrary only displays the data but doesn't insert it into the database.
